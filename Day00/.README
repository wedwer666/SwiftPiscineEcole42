Create project with multiple pages in xcode, swift
A calculator that contains:
As UIButton:
• The chips
From 0 to 9
• 'AC' which will reset the calculator
• '=' which will execute the operation with the 2 operands
The operators '+', '-', '/', '*'
• 'NEG' which will take the opposite of the current number
Once all the UIButtons are placed correctly, make sure the AutoLayout
Is always managed (on all devices and all modes).
The keys assigned to the chips
Must be able to modify the UILabel by changing
The number
But the other keys will not be programmed for the
moment.
You will be able to add a bit of debug. With each support on a UIButton,
Its action must be written to the debug console (the format is free).
